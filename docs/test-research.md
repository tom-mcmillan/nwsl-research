## Overview

This page serves as a template for future research articles and demonstrates the formatting capabilities of our documentation system.

## Research Question

How can we effectively analyze and present NWSL data to provide actionable insights?

## Data Visualization

### Sample Chart

    Interactive visualizations will be embedded here using JavaScript libraries.

## Statistical Analysis

### Descriptive Statistics

| Metric | Value | Std Dev |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Goals per Game | 2.73 | 0.45 |
| Shots on Target | 8.2 | 2.1 |
| Pass Completion | 78.5% | 5.3% |

### Advanced Metrics

We calculate several advanced metrics:

- **xG (Expected Goals)**: Probability-based goal prediction
- **xA (Expected Assists)**: Likelihood of pass becoming assist
- **PPDA (Passes Per Defensive Action)**: Pressing intensity metric

## Mathematical Formulas

The expected goals model uses logistic regression:

$$P(goal) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n)}}$$

Where:
- $x_i$ represents feature values (distance, angle, etc.)
- $\beta_i$ represents learned coefficients

## Code Snippets

### Data Processing Example

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def calculate_xg(shot_distance, shot_angle):
    """
    Calculate expected goals based on shot location
    """
    # Simplified xG calculation
    distance_factor = np.exp(-0.1 * shot_distance)
    angle_factor = np.cos(np.radians(shot_angle))
    
    xg = distance_factor * angle_factor * 0.5
    return min(xg, 1.0)
```

## Interactive Elements

!!! example "Try It Yourself"
    Future versions will include interactive calculators and data explorers.
