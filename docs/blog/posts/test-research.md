# Building a Data Analysis Framework for NWSL Research

This post demonstrates our approach to analyzing NWSL data and the tools we use to generate insights.

<!-- more -->

## Overview

This article serves as a guide to our research methodology and demonstrates the formatting capabilities of our documentation system for presenting complex statistical analyses.

## Research Question

How can we effectively analyze and present NWSL data to provide actionable insights for teams, analysts, and fans?

## Data Visualization

### Interactive Visualizations

We use modern JavaScript libraries to create interactive charts that allow users to explore the data themselves.

!!! info "Chart Capabilities"
    Our visualizations support:
    - Zooming and panning
    - Hover tooltips with detailed information
    - Dynamic filtering
    - Export to PNG/SVG

## Statistical Analysis

### Descriptive Statistics

Our baseline analysis includes standard metrics:

| Metric | Value | Std Dev |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Goals per Game | 2.73 | 0.45 |
| Shots on Target | 8.2 | 2.1 |
| Pass Completion | 78.5% | 5.3% |
| Possession | 50% | 8.7% |

### Advanced Metrics

We calculate several advanced metrics to provide deeper insights:

- **xG (Expected Goals)**: Probability-based goal prediction
- **xA (Expected Assists)**: Likelihood of pass becoming assist
- **PPDA (Passes Per Defensive Action)**: Pressing intensity metric
- **Field Tilt**: Territorial dominance indicator

## Mathematical Formulas

### Expected Goals Model

The expected goals model uses logistic regression:

$$P(goal) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n)}}$$

Where:
- $x_i$ represents feature values (distance, angle, etc.)
- $\beta_i$ represents learned coefficients

### Poisson Distribution for Goals

We model goal scoring using the Poisson distribution:

$$P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$$

Where $\lambda$ is the expected number of goals.

## Code Implementation

### Data Processing Pipeline

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from typing import Tuple

def calculate_xg(shot_distance: float, shot_angle: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate expected goals based on shot location
    
    Args:
        shot_distance: Distance from goal in meters
        shot_angle: Angle to goal in degrees
    
    Returns:
        xG value between 0 and 1
    """
    # Simplified xG calculation
    distance_factor = np.exp(-0.1 * shot_distance)
    angle_factor = np.cos(np.radians(shot_angle))
    
    xg = distance_factor * angle_factor * 0.5
    return min(xg, 1.0)

def process_match_data(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Process raw match data for analysis
    """
    # Calculate rolling averages
    df['goals_ma'] = df['goals'].rolling(window=5).mean()
    df['xg_ma'] = df['xg'].rolling(window=5).mean()
    
    # Add performance indicators
    df['overperformance'] = df['goals'] - df['xg']
    
    return df
```

### Visualization Example

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

def plot_xg_timeline(match_data):
    """
    Create xG timeline visualization
    """
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 6))
    
    # Plot cumulative xG
    ax.step(match_data['minute'], 
            match_data['home_xg_cumulative'], 
            where='post', 
            label='Home xG',
            color='#3B82F6')
    
    ax.step(match_data['minute'], 
            match_data['away_xg_cumulative'], 
            where='post', 
            label='Away xG',
            color='#EF4444')
    
    # Add goal markers
    for goal in match_data[match_data['goal'] == True].itertuples():
        ax.scatter(goal.minute, goal.cumulative_xg, 
                  s=100, c='gold', edgecolor='black', 
                  zorder=5)
    
    ax.set_xlabel('Match Minute')
    ax.set_ylabel('Cumulative xG')
    ax.legend()
    
    return fig
```

## Interactive Elements

!!! example "Try Our Tools"
    We're developing interactive calculators that allow you to:
    - Input match conditions and get predicted outcomes
    - Adjust model parameters and see how predictions change
    - Compare different teams' statistical profiles

## Best Practices

When conducting sports analytics research:

1. **Data Quality**: Always validate your data sources
2. **Sample Size**: Ensure sufficient data for statistical significance
3. **Context**: Consider external factors (injuries, weather, importance)
4. **Validation**: Use proper train/test splits and cross-validation
5. **Interpretation**: Be cautious about causal claims

## Conclusions

This framework demonstrates how we approach NWSL data analysis, combining:
- Rigorous statistical methods
- Modern machine learning techniques
- Clear, interactive visualizations
- Reproducible code

Our goal is to make advanced analytics accessible to the broader NWSL community.
